🎬 Netflix Content Insights Dashboard
🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Tableau Netflix Content Insights Dashboard is a dynamic and interactive data visualization project designed for media analysts, content strategists, and streaming enthusiasts. It provides a comprehensive visual analysis of the Netflix content library, allowing users to explore trends in content type, geographic distribution, release patterns, and genre popularity over time. The primary purpose is to transform the complex catalog data into actionable insights for understanding Netflix's content strategy and evolution.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

📊 Tableau Desktop – The primary platform used for connecting to the data, defining hierarchies, and designing the interactive dashboards and sheets.

🧠 Tableau Calculated Fields – Employed for creating custom metrics such as Content Age, breakdown percentages, and calculated measures necessary for time-series analysis.

📂 Tableau Hyper – The project utilizes a Tableau Hyper data extract for efficient, high-performance querying and analysis of the underlying content data.
The data source is stored internally within the workbook: Data/TableauTemp/#TableauTemp_0y6l5uk0081s7u14eojeh12d7dr1.hyper.

📁 File Format – Developed as a Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx), which includes the dashboard, worksheets, and the hyper data extract, making it readily viewable and shareable.

📊 Data Source
The project uses a dataset containing information about the movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform.

Source: Publicly available Netflix Content Dataset (e.g., Kaggle or similar public data repositories).

Data Content: The dataset typically includes records on thousands of titles, featuring dimensions such as:

Content Metadata: Title, Type (Movie/TV Show), Release Year, Date Added to Netflix.

Descriptive Attributes: Rating, Duration/Seasons.

Contributors: Director and Cast details.

Classification: Listed Genre(s).

Geographic Data: Country of Production/Distribution.

✨ Features / Highlights
The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide clear, actionable insights into the Netflix content strategy.

Business Problem: The sheer volume and diversity of content on Netflix make it challenging to quickly grasp the nature of the library, the pace of content acquisition, and key focus areas for production and licensing.

Goal of the Dashboard: To create an intuitive, visual interface that allows users to segment the library and easily track content diversity, geographical focus, and changing consumption trends.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical)
Content Volume KPIs: Highlighting the Total Count of Movies and Total Count of TV Shows in the library.

Content Growth Over Time: A line chart showing the cumulative or annual Number of Titles Added to the platform, indicating content investment patterns.

Type & Rating Distribution: Bar charts or pie charts displaying the percentage split between Movies vs. TV Shows and the distribution of content across different Rating Categories (e.g., TV-MA, R, PG-13).

Geographic Content Focus: A map or ranked list showing the countries with the highest volume of content production/release.

Genre and Top Creator Analysis: Visualizations ranking the most popular Genres and listing Top Directors or Actors/Actresses based on the number of titles they are associated with.
